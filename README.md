# Scientific Calculator

A scientific calculator that uses MIPS Assembly Language, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Additionally, it supports the conversion between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal values. The calculator also includes logarithmic calculations (log10 and log2), trigonometric functions (sin, cos), power functions, and square root calculations. Furthermore, it features a help guide that can be displayed on the application's terminal.


## Installation

-Download the Mars4_5.jar file from the MIPS simulator's official website.

-Place the Scientific Calculator code in a directory accessible by the MIPS simulator.

-Ensure Java is properly set up and configured on your system to run the JAR file.
## Known Issues and Limitations

-Lack of Error Handling:
Currently, the calculator does not include comprehensive error handling for incorrect inputs or operational errors (like division by zero). This can lead to unexpected behavior under certain conditions. Users are advised to enter inputs carefully and ensure they are valid according to the operations they wish to perform.

-Logarithmic and Trigonometric Functions: The log10, log2, sin, and cos functions are currently in development. They may not produce accurate results or may not be operational at all.
