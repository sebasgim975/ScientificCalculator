# Scientific Calculator

A scientific calculator that uses MIPS Assembly Language, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Additionally, it supports the conversion between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal values. The calculator also includes logarithmic calculations (log10 and log2), trigonometric functions (sin, cos), power functions, and square root calculations. Furthermore, it features a help guide that can be displayed on the application's terminal.


## Installation

1. Install Java JDK

-Go to the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk22-linux).

-Select the appropriate JDK for your operating system (make sure itâ€™s JDK 11 or higher).

-Download and install the JDK following the instructions provided on the website.

2.Download MARS:

-Download the [MARS MIPS simulator](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm).

3. Git:
   
-Git is required for version control management and cloning the repository. Download and install it from [Gitâ€™s official site](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

4. Clone the repository using a Terminal app:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sebasgim975/ScientificCalculator.git
```

## Usage

1. Open the Program:

-In MARS, click on File > Open and select the .asm file from your local directory where you have cloned or downloaded the repository.

2. Assemble the Program:

-Click on the assemble button (the crossed wrench and screwdriver symbol) on top of the page to compile the program without errors.

3. Run the Program:

-To run the program, click on the run button (icon with a green play symbol). Monitor the output in the provided console within MARS.

##Customization:

-In MARS, click on Settings > Editor in order to customize the font as one sees fit (font style, size, etc).

## Known Issues and Limitations

-Lack of Error Handling:
Currently, the calculator does not include comprehensive error handling for incorrect inputs or operational errors (like division by zero). This can lead to unexpected behavior under certain conditions. Users are advised to enter inputs carefully and ensure they are valid according to the operations they wish to perform.

-Logarithmic and Trigonometric Functions: The log10, log2, sin, and cos functions are currently in development. They may not produce accurate results or may not be operational at all.
